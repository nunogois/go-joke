# go-joke

A simple command line joke app written in Go using https://github.com/15Dkatz/official_joke_api

Install the app by running: `go install` and then simply run `joke` on your terminal for a random joke!

You can also ask for a specific type of joke, e.g. `joke programming`

You can also build the app by running:
`go build`

I'm still learning Go, so let me know if you catch something wrong!
